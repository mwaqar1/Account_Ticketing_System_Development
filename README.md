# Account Ticketing System Project in C 


## Project Overview
The Account Ticketing System project was developed to streamline the management of customer support tickets within an organization. The system allows agents to create, view, and manage support tickets, ensuring efficient resolution of customer issues. Key features include robust authentication, persistent data storage, comprehensive ticket management, and a user-friendly interface.

**Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented new data types (Message, Ticket, and AccountTicketingData), enhancing data structure and management.
- Improved data validation routines to ensure adherence to business rules and maintain high data quality.
- Added new menu options for agents, improving the user interface and user experience.
- Enhanced the login process with robust authentication, incorporating account number, user login identifier, and password validation.
- Developed functionalities for creating, viewing, and managing ticket information, allowing for comprehensive ticket management.
- Successfully displayed ticket summaries and detailed message views, providing clear and concise information to users.
- Developed functions to read data from text files (`accounts.txt` and `tickets.txt`) for persistent storage, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- Ensured proper data loading and handling, allowing the system to restart with previously saved states.
- Validated data to prevent array overflows, enhancing system reliability.
- Finalized the implementation of persistent storage by enabling data saving to text files upon agent logout, ensuring data persistence.
- Refined the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices, including consistent formatting, comprehensive comments, and modular design principles.
- Implemented feedback from previous milestones to improve overall system functionality and user experience.

**Difficulties:**
- Understanding the requirements for new data types and integrating them seamlessly into the existing system.
- Ensuring data validation routines were comprehensive and robust enough to handle all edge cases.
- Implementing a secure and efficient authentication process that could handle multiple validation criteria.
- Ensuring the ticket management functionalities were intuitive and user-friendly while maintaining data integrity.
- Managing file I/O operations and ensuring data was read and written correctly without data loss or corruption.
- Handling scenarios where the data files contained more records than the application could store.
- Ensuring that all feedback from previous milestones was correctly implemented and that the final system was polished and free of bugs.
- Balancing the need for comprehensive functionality with the constraints of maintainability and code readability.


## Key Achievements
- Created and tested new data types and validation routines, ensuring data quality and adherence to business rules.
- Integrated robust login authentication with enhanced security measures, improving system security.
- Developed comprehensive functionalities for ticket management and data persistence, allowing for efficient and effective user interactions.
- Ensured seamless data loading and saving for application restart capabilities, providing a reliable user experience.
